		<h3>Welcome to the NEW YFA Website!</h3>
		<p>
		<%= image_tag("welcome_llama.png", :style => "float: right;") %>
		You either tried to access something on the site that requires registration, or you just happened to be logged in to CAS. Either way, we're glad you got here!
		</p>
		<p>
		The site's internals have been redesigned from the ground up, and that means we're going to associate your netid with your account. There's a ton of cool perks that come with this: No more remembering passwords to your shows, keep track of all your auditions in one place, and use the same login you already use at Yale!
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyways we know you were doing something, and we'll get you back there in one second, but first <b>please take a minute to fill out your basic information.	You'll only have to do this once!</b>
		</p>
		Your NetID: <b><%= session[:cas_user] %></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not you? <%= link_to "Logout", logout_path %><br />
