One of the showtimes for <%= @film.title %> has been altered, we thought you'd want to know:

NOTE: Blanks for old imply that this is a new showtime. Blanks for new imply deletion

<% @showtime.changes.each do |attribute, values| %>
Attribute: <%= attribute %>
Old Value: <%= values.first %>
New Value: <%= values.last %>

<% end %>
Thanks!
